As a musician, I've been told that I think differently, in sounds and pictures rather than in words. Software development has always fascinated me, just like music it demands skills that combine logical problem-solving with creative thinking. In pursuit of a career founded on continuous self-improvement, I'm looking to join an ambitious team with a shared vision. After graduating from Europe's leading developer bootcamp in 2016 I now spend most of my time exploring new technologies and ~~nesting callbacks~~ ~~chaining promises~~ async/ awaiting.

## Skills

#### Software Development

Over 5 years of experience in developing digital products and services has taught me the importance of writing clean maintainable code. Following industry best practices comes naturally to me and I believe that the best code is easy to understand and easy to delete. With experience across the entire stack, I am comfortable in both frontend and backend positions. My current areas of interest include container orchestration tools such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and component-driven design tools such as [Framer](https://www.framer.com/).

#### Product Management

At the core of every successful project I have ever worked on lies good communication, a skill that I once feared but have come to master over time. I have successfully managed projects from the idea stage to production. The lifecycle of a product can be full of blockers, iterations, and pivots. I have acted as a clear and concise voice that helps to bridge the divide between engineering and commercial teams at companies.

#### UX/UI Design

A big part of what attracts me to the tech industry is that it presents new challenges in all shapes and sizes, including that of design. As the sole UX/UI designer of [Tunebase](https://tunebase.com), I applied my creative thinking in both a digital and non-digital environment allowing me to tackle these challenges from a different perspective. As a product-focused developer, my first concern is always the end-user. Not afraid to take chances, I know that in an ever-changing tech industry you need to be able to explore innovative and original ways to go about solving problems.

## Experience

**Tunebase (June 2019 - Present)**

[https://tunebase.com](https://tunebase.com)

As the founder and CEO of my own tech company, I have learnt what it takes to build and maintain a production-grade application. Navigating the startup world can be a rollercoaster, and I was forced to learn quickly, fail fast, and forever adapt.

Throughout my time at Warner Brothers, I built up amazing relationships and achieved many great things. One of my proudest moments was being awarded a 2x platinum plaque by BPI for sales in excess of 600,000 for [my song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBFEBeOTGXc) on the Chase and Status album 'No More Idols'.

**Touring - Various artists (2013 - Present)**

Touring around the world brought upon many unpredictable challenges to overcome. It brought out a determination in me to succeed in a very competitive industry. A skill that I now take into every new challenge I face. I became an expert time manager and learnt how to focus my time and energy with ruthless efficiency. My most recent work in this area has been [singing around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61l3m2PgX8w#t=1m) with Rudimental including our support of Ed Sheeran on his sold out stadium world tour.

**_disclaimer:_**

Sometimes I know things and sometimes I don't. I'm ok with that because at _all times_ I work on moving the latter to the former (and if all else fails there's probably an npm package for it üì¶).
