[Skills](#skills) | [Experience](#experience) | [Side Projects](#projects) | [Education](#education) | [Interests](#interests)

As a musician I've been told that I think differently, in sounds and pictures rather than in words. Software development has always fascinated me, just like music it demands skills that combine logical problem-solving with creative thinking. In pursuit of a career founded on continuous self-improvement, I'm looking to join an ambitious team with a shared vision. After graduating from Europe's leading developer bootcamp in 2016 I now spend most of my time exploring new technologies and ~~nesting callbacks~~ ~~chaining promises~~ async/ awaiting.

## Skills

#### Collaboration

Working as a writer it was my job to collaborate with other people, to construct musical stories and relatable lyrics. In being able to see things from other peoples point of view I have learnt to make effective decisions based on both emotional reasoning and intuition. At the very core of every successful collaborative project I have ever worked on lies good communication, a skill that I once feared but have come to master over time. Working in a team has enabled me to create some of my best work.

#### Creative thinking

A big part of what attracts me to coding is that it presents new challenges in all shapes and sizes. My ability to apply creative thinking in both a digital and non-digital environment allows me to tackle these challenges from a different perspective. Not afraid to take chances, I know that in an ever changing tech industry you need to be able explore innovative and original ways to go about solving problems.

Working as both an artist signed to Warner Brothers Records and a writer published by Warner Chappel I gained a variety priceless skills and expertise.

- **People management**: In charge of organising and managing various tours with various musicians I learnt the importance of becoming a great listener and being able to relate to others.

Throughout my time at Warner, I built up amazing relationships and achieved many great things. One of my proudest moments was being awarded a 2x platinum plaque by BPI for sales in excess of 600,000 for [my song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBFEBeOTGXc) on the Chase and Status album 'No More Idols'.

Touring around the world brought upon many unpredictable challenges to overcome. It brought out a determination in me to succeed in a very competitive industry. A skill that I now take into every new challenge I face. I became an expert time manager and learnt how to focus my time and energy with ruthless efficiency. My most recent work in this area has been [singing around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61l3m2PgX8w#t=1m) with Rudimental including our support of Ed Sheeran on his sold out stadium world tour.
