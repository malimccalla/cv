As a musician I've been told that I think differently, that I think in sounds and pictures rather than in words. Software development always seemed a perfect fit as it combines logical problem-solving with creative thinking. After graduating from Europe's leading developer bootcamp last year I now spend most of my time perfectly aligning pixels, ~~nesting callbacks~~ chaining promises, and turning red tests green.
