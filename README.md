As a musician I've been told that I think differently, in sounds and pictures rather than in words. Software development has always fascinated me, just like music it demands skills that combine logical problem-solving with creative thinking. In pursuit of a career founded on continuous self-improvement, I'm looking to join an ambitious team with a shared vision. After graduating from Europe's leading developer bootcamp last year I now spend most of my time perfectly aligning pixels and ~~nesting callbacks~~ chaining promises.
